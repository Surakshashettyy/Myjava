//Check whether the given number is Armstrong number or not
//An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
//For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 153=1^3+5^3+3^3
//Step 1: Find the number of digits in the given number (d)
//Step 2: Find the sum of the cube of each digit (lastDigit)^d
//Step 3: If the sum is equal to the given number, then it is an Armstrong number sum==num
